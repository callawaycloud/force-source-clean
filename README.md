## How it works

The implementation of this command is VERY simple.  

It basically just replaces the contents of ALL the files with in `packageDirectories` with "marker content" (EG `[DELETE_ME]`).  After refresh, it then looks for any files which still contain the "marker" and removes them.

The original plan to look at last modified timestamps, but the `force:source:retrieve` command is optimized to not write if the file has not changed.

As of this release, if the retrieve command fails, it will not revert the "marked" contents.  Hopefully you heeded the warning and have everything in source control. 


## Disclaimer

I have only tested this command with my personal configuration.  As with anything you install, I highly recommend you take time to read the source and understand what it does before executing it.
